## Web project for automatic price update

The main idea is to make it easy to update prices from wholesalers to small companies. This is a hard task in countries where inflation makes the prices of every product change at all times, even more than two or three times a month.

### For helping with that need we need to do

- get the data of products from the webs of wholesalers
- save that data into the database
- provide an endpoint to make a frontend that can manage and use that info
